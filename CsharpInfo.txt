C# syntax is highly expressive, yet it is also simple and easy to learn. 
The curly-brace syntax of C# will be recognizable to anyone familiar with C, C++, Java.
Developers who know any of these languages are typically able to begin to work productively,
in C# within a very short time.
C# syntax simplifies many of the complexities of C++ and provides powerful features such as 
nullable value types, enumerations, delegates, lambda expressions and direct memory access,
which are not found in Java.
C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance,
and iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom iteration
behaviors that are simple to use by client code. 
Language-Integrated Query (LINQ), 
expressions make the strongly-typed query a first-class language construct.
As an object-oriented language, C# supports the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance,
and polymorphism. All variables and methods, including the Main method,
the application's entry point, are encapsulated within class definitions.
